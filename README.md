# mutative

Inspired by [ArrowJS](https://www.arrow-js.com/)'s `reactive` function that converts regular data objects into observed data objects, this class aims to do the same with DOM elements so that DOM changes triggered by something other than ArrowJS can easily trigger events.

## Use 

Import the package by saving it locally or by using [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com/) or [esh.sh](https://esh.sh/).

```
// local file
import mutative from "./mutative.min.js";
//jsDelivr
import mutative from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@jackcarey/mutative@1.0.0/mutative.min.js"
// jsdelivr (with ESM)
import mutative from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@jackcarey/mutative/+esm"
// esh.sh
import mutative from "https://esm.sh/@jackcarey/mutative"

//GitHub (latest version)
import mutative from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jackcarey/mutative/mutative.min.js"

```

```
```

```
```
